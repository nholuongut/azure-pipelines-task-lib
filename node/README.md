Libraries for writing [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines) tasks

Reference examples of our in the box tasks [are here](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks)

## TypeScript Tasks

Cross platform tasks are written in TypeScript.  It is the preferred way to write tasks once.

Step by Step: [Create Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-build-task?view=vsts)

Documentation: [TypeScript API](https://github.com/nholuongut/azure-pipelines-task-lib/blob/master/node/docs/azure-pipelines-task-lib.md), [task JSON schema](https://aka.ms/vsts-tasks.schema.json)

Guidance: [Finding Files](https://github.com/nholuongut/azure-pipelines-task-lib/blob/master/node/docs/findingfiles.md), [Minimum agent version](https://github.com/nholuongut/azure-pipelines-task-lib/blob/master/node/docs/minagent.md), [Proxy](https://github.com/nholuongut/azure-pipelines-task-lib/blob/master/node/docs/proxy.md), [Certificate](https://github.com/nholuongut/azure-pipelines-task-lib/blob/master/node/docs/cert.md)

## Node 10 Upgrade Notice

Azure DevOps is currently working to establish Node 10 as the new preferred runtime for tasks, upgrading from Node 6.
Relevant work is happening in the `master` branch and the major version should be used with Node 10 is 3.
Previous major version is stored in the `releases/2.x`

### Upgrading to Node 10

Upgrading your tasks from Node 6 should be relatively painless, however there are some things to note:
* Typescript has been upgraded to TS 4. Older versions of TS may or may not work with Node 14 or the 3.x branch. We recommend upgrading to TS 4 when upgrading to task-lib 3.x.
* Node has made some changes to `fs` between Node 6 and Node 10. It is worth reviewing and testing your tasks thoroughly before publishing updates to Node 10.

## Reference Examples

The [ShellScript Task](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/ShellScriptV2) and the [XCode Task](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/XcodeV5) are good examples.
